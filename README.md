# Music Recommendation System using Spotify API and Python

This repository provides tools and functions to build a Music Recommendation System using the Spotify API and Python. The system leverages Spotify's vast music catalog and user data to generate personalized music recommendations based on audio features and popularity.

## Overview

Music Recommendation Systems are designed to suggest music tracks or playlists to users based on their listening history, preferences, and other interactions. This project utilizes the Spotify API to access music data, including tracks, albums, artists, and playlists, enabling the creation of a robust recommendation system.

## Features

- **Access Spotify Data**: Retrieve comprehensive music data including tracks, albums, artists, and playlists using Spotify API.
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Recommend music based on similar audio features such as danceability, energy, and tempo.
- **Weighted Popularity**: Incorporate release date-based popularity scores to prioritize newer music releases in recommendations.
- **Hybrid Approach**: Combine content-based recommendations with popularity-based scores for more personalized suggestions.

## Setup Instructions

To set up the project and start building your own Music Recommendation System:

1. **Create a Spotify Developer Account**:
   - Sign up at [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/) to obtain API credentials.

2. **Install Required Packages**:
   - Use `pip` to install necessary libraries:
     ```bash
     pip install spotipy pandas scikit-learn
     ```

3. **Get API Credentials**:
   - Obtain your `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET` from Spotify Developer Dashboard.

4. **Run the Code**:
   - Execute Python scripts provided in this repository to fetch music data and generate recommendations.

## Example Usage

### Fetch Music Data from Spotify Playlist

```python
from spotify_utils import fetch_playlist_data

# Replace playlist_id with your desired Spotify playlist ID
playlist_id = "37i9dQZF1DX76Wlfdnj7AP"
music_data = fetch_playlist_data(playlist_id, client_id, client_secret)
print(music_data.head())
```

### Generate Music Recommendations

```python
from recommend import content_based_recommendations, hybrid_recommendations

# Example using content-based recommendations
input_song_name = "Shape of You"
content_rec = content_based_recommendations(input_song_name, num_recommendations=10)
print("Content-Based Recommendations:")
print(content_rec)

# Example using hybrid recommendations
hybrid_rec = hybrid_recommendations(input_song_name, num_recommendations=10, alpha=0.5)
print("Hybrid Recommendations:")
print(hybrid_rec)
```
